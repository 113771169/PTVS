# Python Tools for Visual Studio

Welcome to our new home on github!

We're still working on the transfer, but we are mostly up-and-running. You may notice a bit of experimentation as we figure out the best way to move our team from our old system.

Downloads of [PTVS 2.1](https://pytools.codeplex.com/releases/view/109707) and [PTVS 2.2 Beta](https://pytools.codeplex.com/releases/view/612409) are still available from CodePlex, but new releases will be here and linked from [microsoft.github.io/PTVS](https://microsoft.github.io/PTVS).

Our [documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/wiki) is now on the wiki, and is _mostly_ looking good (feel free to help us out). Also, the [issue tracker](http://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues) here is where we are managing bugs and feature requests, as well as any questions you may have. We are not planning to transfer all our [existing issues](https://pytools.codeplex.com/workitem/list/advanced) from CodePlex, so if you have one there that is really important to you, please recreate it with a link to the original so we don't lose it.

Thank you for your patience as we settle into our new home. We hope this will result in making it easier for everyone to participate in the PTVS project.
